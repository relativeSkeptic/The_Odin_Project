# Odin_Recipes

This is the first project in The Odin Project curriculum.

The goal is to create a basic website that offers three seperate links to three seperate recipes.

While the original project did not expect any form of styling, I decided to spruce up the page a bit to give it a little more personality.

This project was primarily designed with HTML and CSS using Tailwind.

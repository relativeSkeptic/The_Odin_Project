                    Meatballs are a classic accompaniment to spaghetti, creating the popular Italian-American
                    dish "spaghetti and meatballs." The meatballs, typically made from a blend of ground meat, 
                    breadcrumbs, and seasonings, are simmered in marinara or tomato sauce to absorb flavor. 
                    They are then served on top of or mixed into a plate of cooked spaghetti, offering a hearty 
                    and satisfying combination of flavors and textures.

                    Carbonara is a classic Italian pasta dish made with a rich sauce of eggs, 
                    cheese (usually Pecorino Romano), pancetta or guanciale (cured pork), and black pepper. 
                    The sauce is created by tossing the hot pasta with the egg mixture, which thickens into 
                    a creamy texture without the use of cream. This dish is known for its simple ingredients 
                    but rich, comforting flavor.

                        Fill a large pot with water and bring it to a rolling boil over high heat.
                        Once boiling, add 1-2 tablespoons of salt to the water. This helps season the pasta.
                        Add the spaghetti to the boiling water and stir occasionally to prevent the noodles from sticking together.
                        Cook according to the package instructions (usually around 8-10 minutes) or until the pasta is "al dente" (firm to the bite).
                        Once cooked, drain the pasta in a colander. You can save a cup of pasta water if you plan to mix it into the sauce.

                <p>
                    You can customize the sauce by adding vegetables, meatballs, or even ground meat like beef or turkey for a more hearty meal.
                    For extra flavor, you can toast garlic or add a pinch of red pepper flakes for a spicy kick.
                    Pair your spaghetti with a side salad and some crusty bread for a complete meal! 
    
                    Enjoy your delicious homemade spaghetti!

                    Tomato sauce is a savory sauce made primarily from cooked tomatoes, often seasoned 
                    with ingredients like garlic, onions, herbs (such as basil and oregano), and olive oil.
                    It is commonly used as a base for pasta dishes, pizzas, and stews, providing a rich, tangy flavor. 
                    Tomato sauce can vary in consistency, from smooth and thick to chunky, depending on the recipe 
                    and intended use.

                    Pasta noodles are a staple in Italian cuisine, typically made from durum wheat 
                    flour and water, and sometimes egg, resulting in a variety of shapes and sizes. 
                    These noodles are boiled in water and served with a wide range of sauces, such as marinara, 
                    pesto, or Alfredo, and can also be used in soups or baked dishes. Pasta noodles are versatile, 
                    offering endless possibilities for flavor combinations and textures in meals.
